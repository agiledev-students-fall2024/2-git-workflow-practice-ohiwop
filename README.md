**The article "GraphQL vs. REST: What Are They, and Which Is Better for You?" is interesting because it breaks down two major ways of handling data in web development. Knowing when to use GraphQl and REST is important. The article explains how GraphQL lets you request exactly what you need from the server, while REST uses fixed endpoints. It also gives examples of when one might be better than the other. This makes it easier to understand which approach might work best for different situations, helping developers make smarter choices for their applications.**
